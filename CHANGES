pmCommand.py v2, Apr 17 2020
  * Switch from Python 2 to Python 3
  * Add possibility to use http instead of https. The change in command line
    argument processing is backwards incompatible. Options are -u / --user to
    specify the user name, and then the http or https base url, like
    http://10.1.3.37
  * Make it possible to directly log in to an Avocent PM (v1 only supported
    reaching PDUs via a Cyclades console server).
  * Major and minor code cleanups and usability improvements.
  * Special thanks to Andreas Thienemann (ixs) for contributions, ideas and
    testing.
